Mastra is an open-source TypeScript agent framework designed to provide the essential primitives for building AI applications. It enables developers to create AI agents with memory and tool-calling capabilities, implement deterministic LLM workflows, and leverage RAG for knowledge integration. With features like model routing, workflow graphs, and automated evals, Mastra provides a complete toolkit for developing, testing, and deploying AI applications.

## Integrating with Next.js and assistant-ui

There are two primary ways to integrate Mastra into your Next.js project when using assistant-ui:

1.  **Full-Stack Integration**: Integrate Mastra directly into your Next.js application's API routes. This approach keeps your backend and frontend code within the same project.

2.  **Separate Server Integration**: Run Mastra as a standalone server and connect your Next.js frontend to its API endpoints. This approach separates concerns and allows for independent scaling.

Choose the guide that best fits your project architecture. Both methods allow seamless integration with the assistant-ui components.
